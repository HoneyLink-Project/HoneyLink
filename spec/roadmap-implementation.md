## 3. Project Management Tool Synchronization

### 3.1 CSV Export Schema

The companion CSV `spec/roadmap-import.csv` matches Jira Cloud bulk upload format.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Summary | Milestone title (e.g., `P1-M1 Traceability Skeleton`) |
| Description | Key actions, deliverables, dependency notes |
| Issue Type | Use `Milestone` (custom type) or `Task` where unavailable |
| Start Date | Planned start (ISO 8601) |
| Due Date | Planned finish (ISO 8601) |
| Assignee | Role ID (mapped to placeholder user account) |
| Labels | Phase identifiers (`P1`, `P2`, …) plus `honeylink-roadmap` |
| Epic Link | Optional: map to phase-level Epic (`EPIC-P1` etc.) |

> **English Comment:** Ensure the role IDs are mapped to placeholder user accounts inside Jira to maintain privacy while preserving accountability.

### 3.2 Jira Import Steps

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell (Jira Cloud example)
# 1. Navigate to https://your-domain.atlassian.net/secure/admin/BulkCreateSetupPage!default.jspa
# 2. Upload spec/roadmap-import.csv
# 3. Map columns as per table above
# 4. Validate rows, confirm assignee mappings, then import
```

### 3.3 Synchronization Cadence

1. WG chairs review roadmap progress during bi-weekly sync (see [spec/notes/governance.md](./notes/governance.md)).
2. Updates captured in Jira, exported back to `spec/notes/archive/roadmap-YYYYMMDD.csv` for immutable records.
3. Governance Council reviews deviations monthly; adjust dates in Jira and reflect changes in ADR entries.
4. For each phase gate, ensure decision log entries include Jira issue keys for traceability.

## 4. Risk & Contingency Register (Phase-linked)

| Risk ID | Phase | Description | Indicator | Mitigation | Owner |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| R-P1-01 | P1 | Traceability board setup delayed | No board by week 2 | Reallocate ENG-ARCH-03 bandwidth, involve QA-LEAD-01 | ENG-ARCH-01 |
| R-P2-02 | P2 | PoC scope creep | >10% backlog expansion | Enforce RFC gate via decision log | ENG-ARCH-02 |
| R-P3-03 | P3 | External review feedback overload | >15 major findings | Buffer 2 weeks, prioritize via risk scoring matrix | OPS-LEAD-01 |
| R-P4-01 | P4 | KPI dashboard data gaps | Missing metrics for >1 week | Integrate telemetry pipeline monitoring, escalate to Telemetry SME | OPS-LEAD-02 |

---

## 5. Traceability Hooks

- Each milestone references corresponding requirement IDs in the project tool via custom field `Spec-Trace-ID` (e.g., `FR-01`, `NFR-07`).
- Decision log updates must cite Jira keys (e.g., `HL-ROADMAP-42`) in the `Related Docs` section.
- Metrics alignment: map milestone outputs to [spec/testing/metrics.md](./testing/metrics.md) categories to ensure SLI/SLO coverage.

---

## 6. Maintenance Notes

- Refresh this plan quarterly; archive previous versions under `spec/notes/archive/` with timestamp.
- If program calendar shifts, maintain relative durations unless new scope is introduced.
- No C/C++ tooling is introduced for planning or tracking; rely on SaaS services with compliance attestation.
