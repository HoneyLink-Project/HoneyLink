# HoneyLink Governance Charter

**Badges:** `ðŸš« No Implementation Code` `ðŸš« No C/C++ Dependencies`

> This charter defines the working group structure, communication channels, and review cadence required to execute the HoneyLink roadmap. Assignees are recorded as role-based identifiers to avoid referencing personal data while keeping accountability explicit.

> **Note:** Each chair is accountable for keeping the roster current in this document and pushing any personnel changes to the Decision Log within 72 hours.

## 2. Communication & Escalation Model

1. **WG Chairs Sync:** Every second Monday 17:00-17:30 JST (Slack huddle `#hl-wg-leads`). Agenda: cross-WG blockers, milestone readiness, and risk alignment.
2. **Roadmap Alignment Review:** First Thursday of each month, co-hosted by Architecture and Operations WGs. Output: alignment memo linked to [spec/roadmap.md](../roadmap.md).
3. **Escalation Path:**
   - Immediate blocker âžœ Notify relevant WG chair via Slack DM and tag `#hl-incident`.
   - If unresolved within 24 hours âžœ escalate to Governance Council (Arch + Sec + Ops chairs) using Matrix secure room `!govcouncil:honeylink.local`.
   - Document resolution in [spec/notes/decision-log.md](decision-log.md) with status `Proposed` or `Approved` as appropriate.

## 3. Review Cadence and Deliverable Mapping

| Cadence | Responsible WG(s) | Deliverables | Acceptance Criteria Reference |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Weekly (per WG) | Respective WG | Meeting minutes stored in `spec/notes/meeting-notes.md` (one entry per session) | Complete agenda coverage, action items with owners, risks logged |
| Bi-weekly Chairs Sync | All chairs | Cross-WG status digest (`/notes/chairs-digest-YYYYMMDD.md`) | Risks reconciled, handoffs clear, outstanding ADR updates identified |
| Monthly Roadmap Review | Architecture + Operations | Updated milestone burndown, risk register refresh | Consistency with [spec/architecture/dependencies.md](../architecture/dependencies.md) and [spec/testing/metrics.md](../testing/metrics.md) |
| Quarterly Audit Prep | Security + Operations | Compliance posture report, DR drill summary | Align with [spec/security/vulnerability.md](../security/vulnerability.md) and roadmap P3 criteria |

## 4. Decision Log Workflow

1. Draft decisions recorded by the originating WG using ADR template within 24 hours of the meeting.
2. Chairs ensure cross-review by impacted WGs before status changes to `Approved`.
3. Operations WG tracks implementation actions in the shared action register (AI IDs inside meeting notes).
4. Security WG validates that no C/C++ dependencies are introduced; Architecture WG verifies backward compatibility before closure.

> **Note:** Ensure every ADR explicitly documents how the choice preserves C/C++ free dependencies and how rollback is supported because these are non-negotiable program constraints.

---

## 5. Metrics & Accountability

- **Attendance Threshold:** Each WG must maintain â‰¥90% attendance for core members per month. Chairs log exceptions in meeting notes and schedule catch-up within 48 hours.
- **Review SLA:** Deliverables requiring multi-WG input (e.g., protocol-spec touches security) must be reviewed within 5 business days; otherwise escalate per Section 2.
- **KPI Linkage:** Tie each WG output to the SLI/SLO catalog in [spec/testing/metrics.md](../testing/metrics.md) to preserve traceability.

---

## 6. Maintenance

- Chairs rotate every two roadmap phases to prevent burnout; nominate successor 30 days prior to transition.
- Update this charter whenever roster or cadence changes; commit message prefix: `docs: governance charter update`.
- Archive superseded versions under `spec/notes/archive/governance-YYYYMMDD.md` to keep history immutable.
