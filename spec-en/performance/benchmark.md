## Benchmarking Goals
- Validate system meets performance requirements in [docs/requirements.md](../requirements.md).
- Establish performance baseline for future regression detection.
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities before production deployment.
- Ensure QoS guarantees (latency, throughput, fairness) under load.

## Methodology
- **Load Profile:** Simulate realistic traffic patterns (steady-state, burst, diurnal variation).
- **Duration:** Minimum 1-hour sustained load. Peak load test for 30 minutes.
- **Environment:** Staging environment matching production scale (1:1 or 1:4 scale).
- **Isolation:** Dedicated benchmark environment. No shared resources with other workloads.
- **Repeatability:** Run each scenario 3 times. Report median and 95% confidence interval.

## Toolchain
- **Load Generator:** Rust-based tool (e.g., custom Tokio-based client, `drill`, `oha`). C/C++-made tools prohibited.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana for real-time metrics.
- **Database:** TimescaleDB for long-term benchmark result storage.
- **Analysis:** Python/Pandas scripts for statistical analysis (no C/C++ extensions).

## Benchmark Scenarios
| Scenario | Description | Load Profile | Target Metric |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Device Pairing | Concurrent device registrations | 100/s sustained, burst to 500/s | P99 < 150ms |
| Telemetry Ingestion | High-frequency sensor data streams | 10k msg/s per priority level | Critical P99 < 80ms |
| Command Fan-out | Cloud â†’ 10k devices broadcast | 1k commands/s | 95% delivery < 1 min |
| QoS Fairness | Mixed priority streams (critical/bulk) | 5k/s critical + 10k/s bulk | Bandwidth ratio 3:1 |
| OTA Download | Simultaneous firmware downloads | 1k devices, 50 MB file | P99 < 10 min, success rate 99.5% |
| Regional Failover | Simulated AZ outage | Normal load during failover | Failover < 2 min, no data loss |

## Key Metrics
- **Latency:**
  - P50, P90, P99, P99.9 (milliseconds)
  - Breakdown: Request queue time, Processing time, Network RTT
- **Throughput:**
  - Requests per second (RPS)
  - Bytes per second (Bps) for data-plane
- **Error Rate:**
  - 4xx errors (client issues)
  - 5xx errors (server issues)
  - Timeout rate
- **Resource Utilization:**
  - CPU (%), Memory (%), Disk I/O (IOPS), Network (Mbps)
- **Fairness (QoS):**
  - Priority lane latency ratio
  - Bandwidth allocation deviation from policy

## Baseline and Targets
| Metric | Baseline (Current) | Target (MVP) | Stretch Goal |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Device Pairing P99 | 200ms | 150ms | 100ms |
| Telemetry Critical P99 | 100ms | 80ms | 50ms |
| Command Fan-out Success | 90% in 1 min | 95% in 1 min | 99% in 1 min |
| QoS Fairness Ratio | 2:1 | 3:1 | 4:1 |
| Regional Failover | 5 min | 2 min | 1 min |

- Baseline established during P0 (Specification Phase).
- Targets reviewed quarterly. Updated in [docs/roadmap.md](../roadmap.md).

## Reporting and Tracking
- **Report Format:**
  - Executive summary: Pass/Fail, Key findings
  - Detailed charts: Latency histograms, Throughput timeseries, Resource utilization
  - Comparison: Current vs. Previous release
  - Recommendations: Optimization actions
- **Frequency:**
  - Per release candidate (RC)
  - Monthly for long-term trend analysis
- **Storage:** Archive reports in `spec/performance/reports/` (Git LFS for binary assets).
- **Integration:** Link results in [docs/testing/metrics.md](../testing/metrics.md) and [docs/notes/decision-log.md](../notes/decision-log.md).

- Benchmarking goals, methodology, and scenarios documented.
- Toolchain and metrics defined. C/C++ tool exclusion confirmed.
- Baseline and target values established.
- Reporting format and tracking process specified.
- Links to requirements and related documents consistent.
