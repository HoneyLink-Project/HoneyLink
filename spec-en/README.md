## Elevator Pitch
HoneyLinkâ„¢ is a next-generation universal wireless protocol that embodies "anyone, anywhere, instantly connected." While maximizing the use of existing wireless physical layers, it dynamically optimizes the latency, bandwidth, and reliability required by applications, making device collaboration experiences "as smooth as honey."

## Problem and Solution Approach
| Problem | HoneyLinkâ„¢ Solution | Measurement Metrics |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| UX fragmentation due to proliferation of multiple protocols | Profile integration and common handshake | 99.5% connection success rate for major use cases |
| Inconsistency in security strength | Industry-standard elliptic curve cryptography and zero-trust design | 100% MITM attack prevention rate (simulation tests) |
| Trade-off between low latency and high bandwidth | Multi-stream QoS and adaptive FEC control | P95 latency â‰¤ 8ms (LL Streams) |
| Difficulty in accommodating both IoT and rich media | Profile-based resource management | Battery life +30%, 4K streaming retention rate 98% |

For detailed functional requirements, please refer to [docs/requirements.md](./requirements.md).

## Vision and Mission
- **Vision:** Provide a "sweet and smooth" connection experience as the global standard for inter-device communication.
- **Mission:** Establish protocol specifications and surrounding ecosystems that are physical-layer independent, highly reliable, and UX-focused, minimizing the burden on both developers and users.
- **North Star Metric:** Session setup completion time under 5 seconds, annual churn rate under 3%.

## Product Principles
1. **Human-Centered:** Always minimize the number of connection operation steps and unify visual/tactile feedback.
2. **Secure by Default:** All channels require encryption and mutual authentication as mandatory.
3. **Adaptive Optimization:** Automatically detect per-stream latency and bandwidth requirements and tune according to network conditions.
4. **Built-in Observability:** Provide SLIs as standard stream metadata for operations and support.
5. **Future Compatibility:** Guarantee backward compatibility through version negotiation and implementation guides.

## Key Scenarios
- **Seamless Gaming Peripheral Connection:** Defined in [docs/requirements.md#use-cases](./requirements.md#use-cases).
- **Hi-Res Audio Streaming:** Bitrate and latency requirements specified in [docs/performance/scalability.md](./performance/scalability.md).
- **Multi-Site IoT Management:** Power-saving profiles and monitoring requirements described in [docs/architecture/dataflow.md](./architecture/dataflow.md).
