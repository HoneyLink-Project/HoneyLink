## Purpose and Test Depth
- Verify functional consistency from end-user perspective and operational resilience.
- Target complete journeys spanning edge devices, cloud services, and management portal.
- Reuse prerequisites verified by unit and integration tests, focusing E2E on UX and SLA compliance.

## Key User Journeys
| Journey | Steps | Success Criteria |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| Device Onboarding | Distribution â†’ Pairing â†’ Authentication â†’ Dashboard confirmation | Activation within 15 minutes, no alerts |
| Alert Response | Anomaly detection â†’ Notification â†’ Operator approval â†’ Command transmission | Correction complete within 5 minutes, audit log consistent |
| OTA Release | Release approval â†’ Staged delivery â†’ Health check â†’ Completion report | Adhere to rollout interruption criteria, failure rate <1% |
| Tenant Expansion | New tenant creation â†’ Policy configuration â†’ Device migration | Work time within 30 minutes, no downtime |

## Operational Scenarios
- **Failure Response:** Regional failure â†’ DR switchover â†’ Backlog resolution.
- **Security:** Key leakage suspicion â†’ Forced rotation â†’ Edge re-authentication. Complies with [docs/security/encryption.md](../security/encryption.md).
- **Performance:** SLA monitoring during peak load. Refer to [docs/performance/scalability.md](../performance/scalability.md).
- **Support:** Remote diagnostics and log retrieval from administrator UI.

## Test Environment and Configuration Management
- Maintain 1/4 scale of production. Complete replication including Observability/Analytics.
- Use IaC parameter `env=e2e` profile and synchronize with [docs/deployment/infrastructure.md](../deployment/infrastructure.md).
- Apply changes via GitOps. Manual settings prohibited.

## Data and Simulation
- Device simulator WebAssembly-based, reproducing 10,000 units. C/C++-made simulators prohibited.
- Tenant data: anonymized actual data subset + synthetic data.
- Set feature flags so logs and telemetry are collected for both normal and abnormal cases.

## Observation and Success Determination
- Key KPIs: Journey completion time, alert detection rate, DR switchover time, user satisfaction proxy metrics.
- Observability: 100% collection of OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs.
- Metrics automatically published to Honeycomb dashboard. Blocker if below baseline value.

## Automation Flow
1. Weekly E2E job (long duration). Ad-hoc execution before release candidates.
2. Procedure: Fresh environment â†’ Data load â†’ Journey execution â†’ Observation report generation.
3. Automatically execute rollback on failure and generate ticket.

## Integration with Release Gates
- E2E results integrated with staging gate in [docs/deployment/ci-cd.md](../deployment/ci-cd.md).
- Halt production release if critical defects remain, register RCA in [docs/notes/decision-log.md](../notes/decision-log.md).
- After success, cross-check with performance results in [docs/performance/benchmark.md](../performance/benchmark.md).

## Acceptance Criteria (DoD)
- E2E test purpose, journeys, and operational scenarios comprehensively defined.
- Test environment and data generation methods described and linked to other documents.
- Success determination and automation flow documented.
- C/C++ dependency exclusion explicitly stated.
- Relationship with release gates organized.
