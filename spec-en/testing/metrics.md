## Metrics Governance Policy
- Metric definition and changes reviewed by QA Lead + SRE + Product Manager.
- Metrics follow SLI/SLO framework and align with non-functional requirements in [docs/requirements.md](../requirements.md).
- Data sources: CI/CD, Observability, ticket management. C/C++-made agents prohibited.
- All metrics recorded in auditable form in [docs/notes/decision-log.md](../notes/decision-log.md).

## Core Quality Metrics
| Category | Metric | Definition | Target |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| Reliability | Deployment Success Rate | Successful releases / Total releases | â‰¥ 99% |
| Regression Prevention | Automated Test Detection Rate | Detected by QA / Total defects | â‰¥ 70% |
| Velocity | Lead Time | PR merge â†’ Production release | â‰¤ 24h |
| Stability | Change Failure Rate | Rollbacks / Releases | â‰¤ 3% |
| Security | Mean Time to Discovery | CVE discovery â†’ Fix start | â‰¤ 48h |

- DORA metrics shared in weekly reports.

## Metrics by Test Layer
| Layer | Key Metrics | Threshold | Related Documents |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Unit | Coverage, Execution time, Flake rate | 90% / 5 min / 1% | [docs/testing/unit-tests.md](unit-tests.md) |
| Integration | Success rate, Retry count, Average latency | 98% / â‰¤1 / â‰¤30min | [docs/testing/integration-tests.md](integration-tests.md) |
| E2E | Journey completion rate, SLA achievement rate | 95% / 99% | [docs/testing/e2e-tests.md](e2e-tests.md) |
| Performance | P99 latency, Throughput achievement rate | 120ms / 95% | [docs/performance/benchmark.md](../performance/benchmark.md) |
| Security | Vulnerability fix SLA, Auth test success rate | 72h / 100% | [docs/security/vulnerability.md](../security/vulnerability.md) |

## Alert Thresholds and Escalation
- Yellow (Caution): Reaches 90% of threshold â†’ Slack + report note.
- Orange (Action Required): Exceeds threshold for 1 cycle â†’ Jira blocker, mitigation task creation required.
- Red (Blocked): Exceeds threshold for 2 cycles â†’ Release halt, deployment gate closure.
- Escalation: QA Lead â†’ SRE â†’ Executive. Meeting convened within maximum 24h.

## Visualization and Reporting
- Dashboard: Looker/PowerBI. Data ETL via Rust services, no C/C++ tools used.
- Update Frequency: Unit/Integration=each commit, E2E=weekly, Performance=quarterly.
- Report Structure: KPI, trend analysis, action items, risk assessment.
- Anomaly Detection: Z-score + Etsy's Seasonal Hybrid ESD algorithm.

## Metrics Review Cycle
1. Weekly: QA review (actual vs target).
2. Monthly: Joint SRE/Product review. Reflect improvements in [docs/roadmap.md](../roadmap.md).
3. Quarterly: Executive review. Review SLO/ZBB (Zero Bug Bounce).
4. Record changes in decision log and notify stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria (DoD)
- Metrics governance and responsibility scope defined.
- Core quality metrics and layer-specific metrics organized in table format.
- Alert thresholds, visualization methods, and review cycle documented.
- C/C++ dependency exclusion explicitly stated and linked to related documents.
- Metrics directly linked to SLO/SLA achievement.
