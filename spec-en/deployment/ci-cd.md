**Badges:** `ðŸš« No Implementation Code` `ðŸš« No C/C++ Dependencies`

> Defines CI/CD pipeline specification for HoneyLinkâ„¢. Describes stages, gates, automation, deployment strategies, and rollback procedures without implementation code or C/C++ dependencies.

## Pipeline Goals and Principles
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Blue/Green or Rolling updates.
- **Automated Quality Gates:** Deploy only after unit/integration/E2E tests and security scans pass.
- **Rapid Rollback:** Automated rollback triggered upon anomaly detection.
- **Reproducibility:** Tag pipeline execution and artifacts for traceability.
- **No C/C++ Dependencies:** Build tools and agents entirely in Rust or language-agnostic containers.

- **Pull Request Stage:** Auto-run unit tests + Clippy + cargo-audit. Block merge on failure.
- **Main Branch Merge:** Package container images, push to registry. Tag with Git commit SHA.
- **Staging Deployment:** Deploy via GitOps (ArgoCD/FluxCD). Auto-trigger integration tests.
- **Production Deployment:** Manual approval gate + automated Blue/Green switchover.

## Quality Gates
| Gate | Trigger | Criteria | Action on Failure |
|------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| PR Gate | Each commit | Unit test pass, Clippy clean, 80%+ coverage | Block merge, notify author |
| Integration Gate | Main merge | Integration test success rate â‰¥98% | Block staging deploy, RCA within 24h |
| Security Gate | Before staging | No critical CVE, SAST clean | Block promotion, security team review |
| E2E Gate | Weekly + RC tag | Journey completion â‰¥95%, no critical alert | Hold production deploy |
| Production Gate | Pre-deploy | Manual approval + smoke test pass | Cancel deployment |

- Gate results logged in [docs/notes/decision-log.md](../notes/decision-log.md).

## Deployment Strategies
### Blue/Green Deployment
- Deploy new version (Green) alongside current (Blue).
- Switch traffic via load balancer after health check.
- Rollback: Instant switch back to Blue on anomaly.

### Rolling Update
- Gradually replace instances (e.g., 10% at a time).
- Monitor each batch. Halt and rollback on error.
- Used for low-risk patches.

### Canary Release
- Route 5% traffic to new version initially.
- Gradually increase to 50% â†’ 100% over 24h.
- Auto-rollback if error rate or P99 latency exceeds threshold.

- Strategy selection documented in [docs/roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) per milestone.

## Rollback Procedure
- **Trigger Conditions:** 
  - Error rate > 1% sustained for 5 min.
  - P99 latency > 200ms sustained for 10 min.
  - Critical alert from Observability (PagerDuty/OpsGenie).
  - Manual trigger by SRE/On-call.

- **Rollback Steps:**
  1. Auto-switch load balancer to previous version (Blue).
  2. Drain new version pods (grace period: 30s).
  3. Notify Slack + create incident ticket.
  4. Execute data rollback if schema migration occurred (refer to [docs/deployment/rollback.md](rollback.md)).
  5. Post-mortem within 48h, update [docs/notes/decision-log.md](../notes/decision-log.md).

## Secrets Management
- Use cloud-native KMS (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
- Inject secrets as environment variables at runtime. Do not embed in images.
- Rotate service account keys quarterly. Audit access logs.
- C/C++-made secret tools prohibited.

## Monitoring and Alerts
- **Golden Signals:** Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation.
- **SLI/SLO:** Defined in [docs/requirements.md](../requirements.md), monitored via Observability stack.
- **Alert Routing:** Critical â†’ PagerDuty, Warning â†’ Slack.
- **Dashboard:** Grafana for real-time metrics, Looker for long-term trends.

## Acceptance Criteria (DoD)
- CI/CD pipeline stages, gates, and criteria documented.
- Deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Rolling, Canary) defined.
- Rollback triggers and procedures specified.
- Secrets management policy described.
- Monitoring, alerts, and observability integration confirmed.
- C/C++ dependency exclusion explicitly stated.
- Links to related documents consistent.
