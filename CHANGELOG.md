## [Unreleased]

### Phase 8: Beta Release (0.1.0-beta.1)

#### Added

**Observability & Configuration (Phase 8.1-8.2)**
- `tracing` integration for structured logging (Pure Rust, no C/C++ deps)
- `tracing-subscriber` with EnvFilter support (RUST_LOG environment variable)
- Logging utilities module (`honeylink_transport::logging`)
- TOML configuration system (`honeylink-config` crate)
- Environment variable overrides (`HONEYLINK_*` prefix)
- Example configuration file (`honeylink.toml.example`)
- Input validation with descriptive errors

**CI/CD & Security (Phase 8.3-8.4)**
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (test, clippy, fmt, doc, security-audit, bench)
- Automated rustdoc deployment to GitHub Pages
- Multi-platform build matrix (ubuntu, windows, macos Ã— stable, nightly)
- Security audit documentation (`docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md`)
- Dependency CVE scanning with `cargo-audit`
- Zero C/C++ dependencies verification

**Core Features (Phase 0-7)**
- P2P discovery system with mDNS and manual peer addition
- QUIC transport with TLS 1.3 (using `quinn` + `rustls`)
- Multi-stream QoS scheduler with 8 priority levels
- X25519-ECDH key agreement for session establishment
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption for stream payloads
- Ed25519 digital signatures for Proof-of-Possession tokens
- HKDF-SHA256 key derivation with context separation
- Automatic key rotation with versioning
- Reed-Solomon FEC for packet loss recovery
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and circuit breaker
- Connection pooling and stream multiplexing
- Telemetry system with OpenTelemetry integration
- Session orchestrator for lifecycle management
- Policy engine for bandwidth and connection policies

#### Changed
- Migrated from `println!` to `tracing` in example applications
- Fixed telemetry test errors (`TelemetryCollector::with_config`)
- Consolidated workspace dependencies (removed duplicates)

#### Fixed
- Duplicate `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` entries in Cargo.toml
- Transport test flakiness in `logging::tests::test_custom_filter_parsing`
- QUIC initialization error handling in production mode

#### Security
- Zero C/C++ dependencies policy enforced (all Pure Rust)
- No known CVEs in dependency tree (cargo-audit clean)
- Memory safety guaranteed by Rust ownership system
- Sensitive data redacted in Debug implementations
- Key material zeroized on drop (using `zeroize` crate)
