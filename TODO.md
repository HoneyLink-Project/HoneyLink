The following tasks **contradict P2P design** and were removed:

- ~~Task 109: Prometheus/Grafana production setup~~ -> Local metrics only
- ~~Task 110: OTLP Collector production deployment~~ -> Local observability only
- ~~Task 111: TimescaleDB setup~~ -> No database needed
- ~~Task 112: Production alert routing~~ -> No server alerts needed
